# OWASP Juice Shop Challenges

This repository contains my hands-on practice solving security challenges from the OWASP Juice Shop â€” a purposely vulnerable web application used to learn web security testing and hacking techniques.

## Challenges Completed

- Score Board Challenge  
- [Login Bypass Challenge](screenshots/login-bypass.png) 
- [Error Handling Challenge](screenshots/error-handling.png)
- [DOM XSS Challenge](screenshots/dom-xss.png)


### What I learned:
- Navigating Juice Shop UI and Score Board  
- Using basic SQL injection techniques  
- Understanding error message vulnerabilities  
- Exploiting DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS)

## How to Run OWASP Juice Shop Locally

1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git`
2. Go to project folder:  
   `cd juice-shop`
3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`
4. Start the app:  
   `npm start`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Next Steps / Future Goals

- Complete more OWASP Juice Shop challenges  
- Learn more about SQL Injection and XSS in-depth  
- Add other security CTFs and labs to this repo  
- Prepare for SOC Analyst role with practical exercises
